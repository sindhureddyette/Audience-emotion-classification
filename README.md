The project involves  concepts like machine learning, sentimental analysis and Naive bayes algorithms. The program is trained in such a way that it can process the input (in the of text) used for model test data. The sci-kit libraries are used, which we have come to know is well-known for machine learning projects. The use of these libraries can be known by studying them through articles. The trained model able to analyze and process the data from the given input.
