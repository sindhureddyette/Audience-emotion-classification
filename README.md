# Audience-emotion-classification
Audience emotion classification using various machine learning models and Flask framework for the interface
The main aim of the project is to create an online feedback system between audience and artists, in order to portray or capture their emotions on the play using machine learning. This feedback used to motivate, improvise the artists on  live concerts.

The project involves  concepts like machine learning, sentimental analysis and various algorithms. The program is trained in such a way that it can process the input (in the of text) and produce graphical representation. The Tensor-flow, sci-kit libraries are used, which we have come to know is well-known for machine learning projects. The use of these libraries can be known by studying them through articles. The trained model able to analyze and process the data from the given input.
